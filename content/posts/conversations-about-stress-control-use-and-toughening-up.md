introtext: We know that stress is unpleasant, harmful, and exhausting. However, according to definitions, stress is, first and foremost, not about the action of an unwanted factor on the body, but about the body's reaction to that factor. It is incredibly interesting that in stress responses, both humans and plants, and even bacteria, involve similar mechanisms. We spoke about such different kinds of stress with Maria Radchenko, Candidate of Biological Sciences, plant physiologist.

**What exactly is stress and what is common between a conflict between people and a sprout of rye affected by a toxic substance?**

First of all, it is important to remind once again that **stress is about the reaction to an adverse factor, not the factor itself**. And this key aspect gives us incredible possibilities and room for action*,* which we will discuss a little later. It is incredibly interesting that in response to almost any unwanted external influence — whether stress due to a conflict on social networks, food poisoning, or the impact of drought on wheat — in our evolutionarily distant cells at the micro level, often somewhat similar processes occur.

"*When I first started working with stressors on plants, I was simply fascinated by the fact that plants have universal mechanisms of defense against stress, which are often incredibly powerful! And, on the other hand, plants can respond very differently to the same stressor. And an inadequate plant response to stress, as they say, can cost it its life. In our herbicide studies (substances used to control weeds in fields) we constantly observe that these substances do not affect some plants much, while in others, herbicides trigger a program of [self-destruction](https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/55/408/2617/524659). So to speak, plants kill themselves.”*

*"One of the universal mechanisms of defense against stress is, for example, the activation of the enzyme glutathione transferase. This enzyme is involved in the processes of detoxifying various toxic substances that get into the plant. And not only in plants! [Glutathione transferase](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1222196/) is found in various groups of living organisms — bacteria, fungi, plants, helminths, insects, mammals. In humans, quite a few of these enzymes are in the liver, which, as is known, performs the role of a kind of filter and—literally—detox-function in our body.”*

**About the anatomy of stress**

Back in the 1920s, physiologist Walter Cannon noted that in response to any irritant the body prepares to < <fight or flee>>. Hence the famous phrase <<Fight or flight!>> as two possible reactions to stress. To fight is to change reality, to adapt (to adapt), and to flee is to run from the threat (this is for those who can run — but not for plants surely — *Maria laughs*). A few decades later Hans Selye named this universal stress response stress (Selye, 1936).

Stress begins **with the reaction phase**. If the strength of the stress does not reach certain threshold values, the **adaptation phase** arrives, followed by the **recovery phase**. If the strength of the stress increases to lethal values, the **damage and death phase** occurs (Gennkel, 1978).

**About joys and pains of adaptation**

**Adaptation**, or acclimatization (lat. <<adapto>> — to adapt), is a general trait of all organisms. An interesting phenomenon is **cross-adaptation**, which means the appearance or increased resistance of organisms to the action of the next stressor as a result of the previous one.

**"*In my work, for example, I [observe](http://www.plantprotection.pl/Decrease-of-the-herbicide-fenoxaprop-phytotoxicity-in-drought-conditions-the-role,93621,0,2.html) this in plants that acquire resistance to herbicides under drought conditions"***

Further, Maria adds that *"these studies also inspire personal searches and reflections on the effects of different stresses on our body and mind"*.

And both adaptation and cross-adaptation have [broad biological significance](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/50/3/217/241447), as different types of stress are constant companions of the existence of all living organisms and drivers of evolutionary processes, where the strongest and most adapted survive.

And although from an evolutionary and biological perspective cross-adaptation is a refined and powerful tool, sometimes it works against us — for example, the emergence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria or weed resistance to herbicides. If the same stressors act too often and too long, and especially when their action is rather moderate, besides temporary metabolic changes, there are changes at the genetic level — resistance arises. Today this is a problem in both medicine and the agricultural sector — the emergence of resistant and even polyresistant (resistant to several antibiotics or herbicides) bacteria and weeds, respectively.

**How to use this for yourself?**

Stress tolerance is not only a desirable item on a resume for many employers, but also a skill that can be developed to some extent.

It is possible both at the physiological and psychological levels. The quirky word **"hormesis"** is now found not only at scientific conferences but even in posts by advanced Instagram bloggers. Essentially, it is a kind of "benefit from a little harm" — the stimulating effect of small doses of stress factors. And here one can find a multitude of examples — cold showers or saunas, sports, and even vaccination.

"*I personally really like the practice of splashing cold water, which in its acute phase (during trembling) is accompanied by a surge of stress hormones—**cortisol** and noradrenaline, but subsequently [leads](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5025014/) to strengthening the immune system and reducing illness from SARS-CoV-2**."*

The history of the formation of the doctrine of hormesis is very interesting. It was first discussed by researcher Hugo Schulz in 1888, who observed the stimulatory effect of small doses of poisonous substances on yeast cells. Further studies by Rudolf Arnndt, who was also an active advocate of homeopathy, played a cruel joke with hormesis, as it caused an associated mistrust of these studies. The term "hormesis" was first used by Zuntman and Ehrlich in their 1943 publication.

Currently [hormesis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-017-0013-z) is once again a popular topic. And its study is not limited to physiology, molecular biology, or biochemistry. [Research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22201278/) into the importance of our attitude toward stress factors gives us new directions in psychology today (for example, stressor-fing). And here the above-mentioned aspect that stress is primarily our own reaction, not so much what happens to us, is used very actively. The essence of stressor-fing is to change one’s attitude toward stress factors and use them to one’s advantage. This is a kind of approach to forming an optimistic, calm, and unshakable attitude to life and a way to enjoy the challenges we have to deal with.

"**All that does not kill us... — happens in various ways...**

Standing in a traffic jam and a street confrontation with an attacker are somewhat different kinds of stress. But many people can really get quite stressed even because of "unfavorable weather," and "such political leaders" and a broken nail. Yet compared to truly frightening challenges that threaten life and health, agree, these are trifles.

"*My attitude toward stress was heavily influenced by Viktor Frankl's book **Man's Search for Meaning: A Psychologist's Experience in a Concentration Camp**. The author of this life-affirming book survived hunger and humiliation in Nazi camps, survived, and his support helped others survive. How did he do it? Because it is such a strong, long-lasting negative stress. And he simply changed his attitude toward this truly terrible situation. I was struck by the brilliant phrase from the book **'We can take away everything from us except our attitude to everything that happens'**.*"

Not everyone, unfortunately, has the incredible fortitude of the main character. Most people still "break" after some critical events in their lives. And those who do not break are unlikely to recall such experience as useful, even if it has strengthened them in some way.

**About pleasant and necessary stress**

Hans Selye conditionally classified stress into eustress (positive stress, exciting — which is necessary for achieving our goals) and distress (negative stress) (Hans Selye <<Stress Without Distress>>, 1982). From the moment a child is born, a little one constantly experiences positive stresses during development — for example, starting to walk and falling. But what a pleasure — to progress more confidently each time! And in adulthood, thanks to positive stresses, a person, by setting new and new goals, with a racing heart moves to a qualitatively new level. Positive stresses are necessary for us; without them aggression, dissatisfaction, and other disorders appear. Biologically we are configured and need stress; our body is prepared for it and demands it. Therefore, by the way, such popularity may have some seemingly destructive film genres and extreme sports — we simply compensate for our < <escape from bears>>.

"**We will build up stress resilience**

The way of life is changing faster than the principles of how our body works. Today, besides fleeing from predators, we also face many other stressors that need to be managed. Improve your stress resilience in a not-too-stressful way, using the principle of hormesis, including the following [ways](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress-relievers/art-20047257):

- **Physical activity.** Here one can speak about hormesis, improved blood circulation, and the complex biochemical synthesis of "happiness hormones" that give us light euphoria, making other life difficulties seem not so difficult. Scientifically, physical activity is [effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28088704) in the fight against stress.

- **Moderate hardening.** This is good prevention of respiratory diseases, and also a way to feel mentally stronger. However, the path and intensity of chosen procedures should be agreed with a doctor, at least at the beginning.

- **Sense of humor.** Look for the strength to smile, because even in response to < <smiling> > facial muscle movements, the brain also [produces](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18562330) < <molecules of happiness> >.

- **Social interactions.** Communicating with friends, family, and even your cat or dog will help distract and feel support.

- **Adequate sleep.** Sleep deprivation triggers anxiety, which definitely does not help ease the fight against stress. So sleep enough — it will be good for immunity and for stress resilience.

- **Hobbies.** This is something that allows us to fully switch off and recharge, diving into the world of yoga, origami, singing, or playing the violin.

- **Avoidance of alcohol and unhealthy food.** Because this only weakens the body's defenses and instead of facing the stress, it has to spend resources on overcoming the harmful consequences of our actions.

If, however, it is still difficult to cope with stress, do not hesitate to consult a qualified specialist. He can help you better understand the situation and offer the most effective strategy for you to fight stress.
