# How to Find "Your" Dentist - Check-list

**How do we look for a doctor?**

Usually, this happens via the Internet, and more often — based on recommendations from acquaintances. There is nothing inherently wrong with either method, but you should be aware of the pitfalls of these two paths:

1 -- information on a clinic's website may be promotional, information on forums may also be paid advertising or anti-advertising. In any case, don’t rely on these sources 100%. On the clinic's site, pay attention to information about **modern equipment, education and experience of the doctors and their completion of various professional development courses**. If you have a habit of looking for reviews on forums or in social networks, pay attention to the **time span during which these reviews were left, as well as their authors**. In addition, assess the **consistency of the texts**, you can also search parts of them for authenticity.

2 -- although recommendations from acquaintances are often the most authoritative for us in choosing a doctor or clinic, remember that this method can also backfire. This can happen for a banal reason: <<**All people are different**>>. A doctor that impressed your neighbor may have the opposite effect on you. This, for example, does not mean that you should not go to a doctor recommended by a friend with whom you have different political views; it only means that you should keep this factor in mind and not rely entirely on someone’s experience.

There are many factors influencing the doctor–patient dynamic. So you will have to rely on both your own critical thinking and... oops, your own feelings. Because your trust in the doctor significantly affects the treatment outcome.

*If the situation is not urgent, be prepared that you may have to visit several doctors — talk with them at consultations, ask questions that interest you, prepare an approximate treatment plan if you anticipate a large amount of work.*

**So how to increase your chances of choosing exactly your dentist? Here is a check-list that we hope will help you with this.**

* Ask questions that interest you. Even if your ideas about some things do not match the doctor's view, you need to know why;
* Ask about modern approaches and trends in their field — dentistry is developing especially rapidly, and if the doctor is oriented in contemporary, evidence-based directions, it is very likely that fillings will last longer :)
* Value a doctor who is willing to answer your questions and who gives you their time;
* A good sign is if the doctor has a patient-centered approach, i.e., he takes your well-being into account, develops and offers parallel treatment strategies and discusses them with the patient, leaving the final say to them;
* It is important that the conclusions and recommendations regarding your health are completely understandable to you — always ask again and clarify — this is your health;
* Very important is when the doctor not only gives proper attention to the treatment process but also emphasizes the importance of preventive measures aimed at preventing complications and the recurrence of the situation.

And just in case, we remind you that a visit to a dentist should be performed at least once a year for preventive purposes. Wishing you pleasant visits and bright smiles!
