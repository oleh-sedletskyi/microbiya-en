# About drinking water – important clarifications

**Water and more**

Traditionally it is said that we are composed of 55-75% water, it is the medium for the course of all biochemical reactions in our body, a heat carrier and solvent. The amount of water affects blood density, water is necessary for the production of synovial fluids that lubricate joints. The cartilage located between the vertebrae requires a constant adequate amount of water — when dehydrated they dry out and lose elasticity and sag, causing pain. A sufficient amount of water is also important for the good condition of the skin, hair, and nails.

*And after such unquestionable statements, how can one not agree to pour a three-liter jar of water and try to drink it with all one’s might before sunset?*

**[However](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/water/art-20044256) it is important to understand that the source of water is not only the water itself, but also other beverages, and also food.** In other words, oatmeal with milk, tea, and soup are also sources of water in your diet.

In addition, during the metabolism of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates in our body, so-called endogenous water is also produced.

All of this total water constitutes the daily volume of fluids that we will discuss in more detail below.

It should be noted that still **the choice in favor of plain water** rather than, say, sugary drinks is [an effective](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/water-drinks-nutrition/) strategy for **reducing the number of calories consumed** and controlling body weight.

**So how much should you drink?**

The amount of water to drink is individual for each person and depends on age, sex, concomitant diseases, level of physical activity, climate, consumption of other beverages besides water, type of food consumed and the number of meals.

For example, **physical activity** — at high levels of physical activity we lose water and electrolytes through sweat. Therefore it is important to drink water before, during, and after physical exercise. If the exercise is intense and lasts more than an hour, specialized sports drinks will help restore minerals lost with sweat.

A lot depends on the environment we are in, namely the **temperature and humidity of the air**. This affects the rate of moisture evaporation from the surface of our skin. It is also worth remembering that at high altitudes, for example, on an **airplane**, the reduced humidity and pressure — drink a glass of water while looking out the window of the porthole — that is what helps.

Our body rapidly loses water and electrolytes during **fever, vomiting, and diarrhea**. In such conditions you should definitely consult a doctor, and under no circumstances ignore their advice. They will probably include electrolyte intake as well. This is especially serious **in the case of children — even a few hours from the onset of illness to the development of severe dehydration with subsequent coma**. Adequate fluid intake is recommended also in urinary tract infections and in kidney stone disease. It is important to drink enough water during **pregnancy and while breastfeeding**.

It is also worth noting that during conditions accompanied by **nausea and cough**, a sufficient amount of fluid is necessary to thin and ease the evacuation of mucus from the airways.

Sometimes you may encounter general [figures](http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/Reports/2004/Dietary-Reference-Intakes-Water-Potassium-Sodium-Chloride-and-Sulfate.aspx) — for a temperate climate the amount of **total fluid intake** for men is about 3.7 L, for women 2.7 L.

Researchers have been calculating recommended individual amounts of fluid intake for several decades, and today one of the most widely accepted methods is this [calculation](https://www.nature.com/articles/ejcn2012157?fbclid=IwAR3G-eavhCp9AKEVN8kJD3ZBy9UhkFWRXasT0shOcqkIlSlNaYSqH0Hz-Ko): 30-40 ml per kg of body weight, and if it is a hot period of the year or a room with intensive heating and dried air — 40-50 ml per kg.

In case of fever, for every degree of increased temperature add 10 ml per kg of body weight. In diarrhea or vomiting you need to consume 50-60 ml of fluid per kg of body weight. And for breastfeeding mothers, the recommended amount of fluid intake is 800-1000 ml more than their own fluid needs.

**Do not confuse** recommendations for **fluid intake** (which [includes](https://www.nature.com/articles/ejcn2012157?fbclid=IwAR3G-eavhCp9AKEVN8kJD3ZBy9UhkFWRXasT0shOcqkIlSlNaYSqH0Hz-Ko) water, drinks, water from food, and water obtained during metabolic processes) with fluid intake **specifically for water**.

For example, if a person weighs 70 kg and should obtain according to the above calculations 2100-2800 ml, this does not mean they should try to gulp a three-liter jar of drink. Because this amount includes 200-300 ml of endogenous water and 400 to 1000 ml from food.

Thus, when we talk specifically about **water and beverages** to drink daily, for an average person this figure is roughly in the range of 1-1.5 L per day.

**Insufficient water intake** can [manifest](https://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/data-statistics/plain-water-the-healthier-choice.html) as fatigue, low blood pressure, dizziness, constipation, and kidney stone formation. Dehydration can also be indicated by the dark color of urine. Normally it should be straw-colored. If it is too light, you may have overdone it and are drinking too much water.

It is important to understand that **older people perceive thirst less accurately** and the very approach of regularly drinking water even when thirst is not felt is relevant for them. Adhering to this principle can be a [preventive measure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2908954/) in preventing a heart attack and excessive fatigue.

In **winter** we usually drink less water. However — more warming beverages. And if they are not paired with pastries, there is nothing wrong with that. In any case, in the form of a glass of water or tea — you should continue to drink a sufficient amount of fluids in winter too, since the low humidity in heated rooms contributes to dryness of the skin and eyes.

It also happens that we **confuse thirst with hunger**. This is often observed during intense mental work, when we focus on a task and forget everything else. Over several hours the amount of water in our blood decreases, its transport functions weaken somewhat, and the brain seems to think that there is not enough glucose. And it ... sends us to search for something sweet. In general, when you face intellectual challenges and at the same time crave cake, first drink a little water.

**How to drink?**

In principle, if you move a lot and feel good, you can drink as you like and as much as you want. However, many of us lead a sedentary lifestyle. Therefore, in such a case it would be comfortable to drink 100-150 ml per hour. Because if you go a long time without drinking and then drink a lot, it may not be very pleasant for the stomach, which stretches with large volumes, and for the vessels and the heart, since the blood volume will rise sharply.

Drinking larger portions of water is better between meals. It is also fine to wash down food — a glass of water with lunch or after it — quite normal, as long as you don’t drink it by force.

Fluid leaves the stomach fairly quickly and is not the main reason for a feeling of heaviness or slow digestion.

It may cause more unpleasant sensations if both water and food are in excess, the body is in a seated position, and tight belt and clothing, as well as visceral fat in the waist area, press on it.

All of this together slows down gastrointestinal motility, but the primary problem, as one might guess, is not exactly the glass of water you drank.

Particularly noticeable is the discomfort after quenching meals with water for people who suffer from **gastroesophageal reflux disease**. In such a case the sphincter between the stomach and esophagus may not close completely, and when consuming large amounts of food and drink, the acidic contents of the stomach are regurgitated into the esophagus and burn it.

**Does water temperature matter?** The most comfortable is room temperature water. Very cold water on an empty stomach can somewhat irritate an empty stomach and accelerate GI motility, so in the morning it is more comfortable to drink a glass of barely warm water.

Cold water may take away a few calories, because the body has to expend energy to warm it. However, do not be fanatical about this fact and treat it as some diet.

**Can you have too much?**

Excessive water intake can also [occur](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/how-much-water-should-you-drink) and cause health complications. This can happen in some thyroid, kidney, heart diseases, taking drugs that promote fluid retention — non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, some antidepressants and pain relievers. In such cases it is important to discuss this with a physician. And, as already mentioned, don’t confuse fluid intake recommendations with how much water you should drink.

**Sparkling or not so much?**

Consumption of sparkling water [does not affect](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/does-carbonated-water-harm-bones) bone strength, as was previously assumed. However, researchers [argue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5702778/), that **drinking carbonated water is not very friendly to dental enamel**.

Regarding the effect of carbonated water on our eating behavior, the data are somewhat contradictory, because on the one hand, carbon dioxide contained in carbonated water may **suppress hunger** — demonstrated [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28757533) in a study of 13 young women.

On the other hand, there are [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28228348) that claim that the carbon dioxide in carbonated beverages **may be involved in weight gain through stimulation of ghrelin — the hunger hormone**.

These results were first obtained in rats, then in 20 men. Therefore, to attribute to carbonated water the claim that it always makes you want something tasty, more extensive studies are needed, including women.

The British National Health Service notes that it is possible that such a link exists and [recommends](https://www.nhs.uk/news/lifestyle-and-exercise/can-fizzy-water-make-you-fat/) choosing plain water to quench thirst.

It should also be understood that carbonated water and carbonated beverages are essentially a weak solution of carbonic acid and negatively affect the protective mucus layer of the stomach, and thus can cause erosions or aggravate peptic disease with constant use.

**"Mineral-curative"...**

When choosing water, you should prefer still table water with mineralization not more than 0.5 g/dm3 (manufacturers indicate this on the label).

High-mineral waters (mineral) can sometimes be consumed for therapeutic purposes, but only on a doctor’s recommendation. **It is the doctor who can advise the type of water that will be appropriate for a given condition** — gastritis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, constipation, kidney stone disease, or arthritis. The consumption of mineral water is possible **only in a state of remission of chronic diseases**, against a backdrop of relatively good health. During exacerbations of GI and urinary tract diseases, consumption of mineral waters will lead to worsening of these conditions.

**Careful, water!**

Water is one of the transmission routes for a number of pathogens, including cholera, hepatitis, and a number of acute intestinal infections. Therefore, the source of water and storage conditions must be approached responsibly.

[Especially](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/how-to-prevent-infections) this applies to travel.

- In tourist trips, use bottled water and buy it from reliable suppliers — in stationary stores, pharmacies, large supermarkets.
- Fruits and vegetables are better cleaned if there are questions about the quality of the water you would wash them with.
- Boil tap water.
- Prefer beverages without ice, since ice is often made from the same tap water.
- If you use water from a vending well or a well, pay attention to the frequency and results of sanitary-epidemiological checks of water from that source.
- Ask your water supplier about its origin and the latest results of microbial control.
- If you use an individual water bottle, remember to regularly clean it thoroughly, especially for **children’s bottles**. Choose **models with the simplest designs** that are easy to clean, and use a separate brush for cleaning.
