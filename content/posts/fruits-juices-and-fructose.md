# Fruits, Juices, and Fructose

**Fruits vs confectionery**

We roughly know about the benefits of fruits since childhood, thanks to "vitamins." At the same time, fruits do contain quite a lot of sugars. So why are they better than other sweets?

[At least](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31451258), by three factors:

- Water content in fruits is about 90%, while in the vast majority of confectionery products it is up to 5%;
- Sugar content in fruits is 10-15% (in dates 65%), while sweets can sometimes exceed 90%;
- The presence in fruits of other valuable nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and also fiber, whereas sweets can become an additional source of saturated and trans fats.

**Fruits vs juices**

On the one hand, fruit juices are associated with "vitamins and minerals," and on the other hand — sometimes a "spoon of tar" in the form of added sugar. But even if it is not some nectar with added sugar, juices contain significantly less fiber than fruits, so all [benefits](chomu-klitkovyna-v-ratsioni-tse-spravdi-vazhlyvo.html) related to fiber will be less pronounced. In addition, sugars from juices are thus absorbed into the blood more quickly and in greater amounts, causing that dreaded spike.

In some studies [it has been shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23990623) that the consumption of whole fruits is associated with a reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes, while consumption of fruit juices — conversely — with increased risks.

The National Health Service of the United Kingdom [recommends](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/the-eatwell-guide/) limiting the amount of fruit juices and smoothies consumed to 150 ml per day.

**Fruits and body weight**

Lately, it has become popular to claim that fruits are a source of a large amount of simple sugars and therefore unsurprisingly lead to weight gain.

However! When it comes to so-called whole fruits, not dried or canned, or fruit juices, there are other factors that are stronger and prevail: high water content, fiber, and the absence of fats. Fructose indeed does not give a strong sense of fullness due to its metabolic characteristics, but this is offset by fiber. Vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants enhance apoptosis in adipocytes (it's like encouraging fat cells to die), reduce oxidative stress, and reduce fat accumulation. In addition, they promote the growth of Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria in the gut, which is associated with lower body weight.

Therefore, [overall](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5084020/) consumption of whole fruits is associated with a reduction in body weight. At the same time, consuming large amounts of fruit juices is not recommended for certain age groups, especially children.

**How much fruit to eat?**

It depends on age, sex, and level of physical activity. According to [the recommendations](https://www.choosemyplate.gov/eathealthy/fruits) from USDA, adult men, as well as women up to age 30, are advised to consume two servings of fruit per day, women over 30 — one and a half servings. Separate recommendations are provided for children and adolescents.

It should be noted that these are recommendations for people with relatively low levels of physical activity.

One serving means 1 glass of fruit juice or chopped fruit, or half a cup of dried fruit.

**Fructose as an added sugar**

Despite the fact that fruits and fructose are beautiful cognate words, it is not advisable to consume it in excess, nor to consider it a better alternative than ordinary sugar.

Added fructose also falls into the category of added sugars and has the same caloric content as glucose.

Given the low glycemic index of fructose (due to slower absorption of fructose from the intestine), it is a popular component in diabetic nutrition. However, this does not mean that it can be consumed in unlimited quantities!

Fructose metabolism does not involve satiety hormones, so it does not give us a feeling of fullness. And excessive consumption of fructose [can lead to](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28878197) fatty liver, visceral fat accumulation, and other metabolic disorders.
