introtext: For one in five women and for one in ten men, the word migraine is not a hollow sound, but a certain verdict that forces you to adjust the rhythm of your life to certain conditions and rituals. Migraine is very versatile — the head can hurt in many ways, it can hurt differently, the reasons and triggers that cause it are myriad, and there are no drugs yet that remove the underlying causes.

# About the “nagging thing”: what you should know about migraine

**What is it?**

Migraine is not just “a headache.” If you have pain in part of the head (hence the initial name hemicrania, which vaguely resembles a fashionable French word migraine), or, less often, – pain on both sides, with the pain intensified by movement, nausea, and sounds and light that make you want to bury your head in the sand – welcome to the club.

About 20% of people who suffer from migraines have what is called an aura. And it isn’t about colored circles over the head, but mini-hallucinations in the form of flashes or spots. And another 10-20% experience prodromal symptoms that may appear up to two days before an attack!

This can be either excessive fatigue, or conversely – a surge of energy, or discomfort in the neck or yawning. As you can see, migraines have a rich menu.

**Why does it hurt?**

Here science has a bit of trouble. Because, as they say, it can be different. It is now known for sure that the predisposition to migraines is genetically determined and associated with changes in more than [38 genes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28271496). Therefore, in different families there is a different idea of how a head can hurt.

As mentioned, **women suffer more**, because triggers are [estrogen fluctuations](https://thejournalofheadacheandpain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s10194-018-0922-7). A weak consolation is that after menopause it becomes somewhat easier.

The worst migraine is when migraine becomes chronic. And the risk of such a torment increases somewhat when there is a prolonged elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the body. This can occur with the presence of some **chronic inflammatory processes**, such as [periodontitis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28478842).

Interestingly, **gastrointestinal disturbances can amplify migraine-like pain**. This was experimentally [shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31378003) in mice. How exactly this happens is not yet known, but the study mentions the key role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF alpha) and, accordingly, the involvement of our gut microbiota (and again it’s here!) in modulating the inflammatory response.

It was also shown that the **frequency of migraine attacks decreased with probiotic use**. And these randomized double-blind controlled trials [were written about](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30621517) in that wonderful summer.

[They also write](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25642431) that for some owners of this enigmatic ailment there is still a dependence on weather conditions.

And, of course, what all “migraineurs” already know – there exists a **huge number of dietary factors** that can act as [triggers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3857910/): chocolate, nuts, cheese, citrus fruits, monosodium glutamate, aspartate, fatty foods and processed meat, and, of course, coffee and alcohol, especially red wine and beer.

Add to this sleep deprivation and stress, which also [contribute to migraine chronification](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27389092).

There is also talk of a **two-way relationship** between migraines and [depression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31106971), migraines and [hypothyroidism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310335).

[Interestingly](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28421374), that **neck pain is more often associated with tension-type headache rather than migraine**.

**Will sport save you?**

According to [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26718237), physical activity, unfortunately, does not cure migraines, but can help raise pain threshold and patient satisfaction, which, you’ll agree, is not bad either.

**About risks to consider**

It is important to know that there is a link between migraines and an increased risk of ischemic stroke. In patients [with aura this risk is doubled!](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5346116/). And in the subgroup of patients with the highest risks – young women. Therefore, given such a background, it is reasonable to try to reduce other risk factors for ischemic stroke: high blood pressure, diabetes, excess weight, high homocysteine level, and dyslipidemia. One of the key recommendations is to quit smoking if you still smoke.

**How to live with it?**

As you can see, migraine is truly multifaceted. And it is really important to figure out for yourself – *what is your migraine?* Therefore, [really useful](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/migraine/prevention/) is the practice, at least temporarily, of keeping a **diary** – to **track your own triggers**. Record the date, start time of the attack, and any events or foods you want to trace a link with.

Treat and **do not let chronic inflammatory processes** develop. Because that increases the risk of chronic migraine.

Whenever possible, avoid working in shifts;

**Get enough sleep** and **avoid stress** – fairly simple, but truly effective recommendations in this case;

Analyze your diet for enough **vitamin D**. According to recent [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31377873), consuming enough vitamin D reduces the frequency of migraine attacks;

And **be sure to consult a doctor**. This is important to rule out other possible pathological conditions. And it is the doctor who will help select effective medications for you, considering all contraindications and possible side effects.
