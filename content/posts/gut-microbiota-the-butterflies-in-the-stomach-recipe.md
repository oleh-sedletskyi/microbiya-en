introtext: The lion’s share of our microbiome is concentrated in our gut—there it is warm, cozy, and always fresh tasty food. Heaven on earth. The area of our digestive tract <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6388077/">spans</a> 250-400 m<sup>2</sup>, which is two orders of magnitude larger than the surface of our skin. In fact, this entire area is covered by a biofilm of microorganisms and serves as the field of interaction between our body and microbes. For a long time it was believed (and is still encountered) that the number of microbial cells inhabiting our body is 10 times larger than the number of our body’s own cells. <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/scientists-bust-myth-that-our-bodies-have-more-bacteria-than-human-cells-1.19136">Recent estimates</a> say that this ratio is somewhat smaller and amounts to 3:1 or even 1:1. The highest microbial density is observed in the colon—one gram of its contents contains 10<sup>12</sup> tiny microbes.

# Gut Microbiota: A Recipe for Butterflies in the Stomach

Studying this whole fraternity is complicated by the fact that most of them are **unable to live** on their own in laboratory test tubes, since they urgently need company—to carry out all those intricate biochemical transformations they are capable of when they are "in the wild." But with the dawn of the genetic research era, scientists have slightly lifted the curtain on the microbial diversity of our insides, establishing that they are home not only to the already well-known Escherichia coli, lactobacilli, and bifidobacteria, but also thousands of other kinds of small creatures.

**What do they all do there?**

The microbes of our gut truly **protect us from foreign microbes**, and they do this less out of love for us and more out of a desire to defend their own niche in the struggle for survival. Nevertheless, the gut microorganisms diligently pay us rent for living space, for example, **synthesizing B vitamins, vitamin K, and folic acid**. Moreover, if we remember to **eat fiber-rich food**, this list adds **short-chain fatty acids**. They **enjoy feasting on the epithelial cells** of our intestines. Short-chain fatty acids [regulate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3807819/) the activity of regulatory T cells and diminish the development of inflammatory processes in the gut. Also, these metabolites interact with enteroendothelial cells (cells in the intestine that can produce certain hormones) and **stimulate their production of a variety of peptides, neurotransmitters, and hormones, including, for example, serotonin and oxytocin**. It has been shown that some bacteria are capable of synthesizing serotonin themselves. So don’t be surprised when life suddenly takes on new colors after some "herbal" salad. It is fair to note that this hormonal joyful cocktail is released from the same enteroendothelial cells and directly [in response](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5794698/) to eating fat- and simple carbohydrate-rich foods. But as you might guess, its effect is somewhat offset by the subsequent glance at your silhouette in the mirror and the transition to bigger pants.

Lately, it has become fashionable to say that the gut microbiota **influences our mood**. And as we see—such discussions are not unfounded. Even more—already today researchers speak about the role of the gut microbiota in the development of such pathological conditions as depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, autism spectrum disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. It is not yet possible to name specific pathogens, however [there is talk of](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953055) subtle correlations between certain groups of microorganisms and the appearance of these conditions and the association with the abundance of some groups of bacteria—clostridia, Desulfovibrio, Bacteroides, Lachnospiraceae.

Studies of gnotobiotes (these unfortunate laboratory animals raised in absolutely sterile conditions) show that the gut microbiota plays an important role in forming the [blood–brain barrier](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4396848/) (this is the barrier that protects our brain from the invasion of microbes), in regulating the process of neuronal [myelination](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4872400/) (the myelin sheath covers neurons and provides electrical insulation), and in the process of [neurogenesis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312816300506) (the development of neurons).

We must also mention the neurotransmitter **gamma-aminobutyric acid** (GABA), which some strains of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and [bacteroides](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-018-0307-3?WT.feed_name=subjects_virology) can synthesize. And this is not only about reducing the likelihood of falling into depression but also [controlling](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15470076) inflammatory responses at a local level.

Another global function of the gut microbiota is the **training of our immune system**. In the early years of life we come into contact with various microbes, and our immune system seems to undergo calibration—learning to respond adequately to antigens and to distinguish friends from foes. If there are not enough microbes, there is a high risk of developing allergies later on.

**How to maintain your gut zen?**

- **Consume fiber-rich foods** — vegetables, fruits, whole-grain products. At the same time, it’s worth avoiding excessive thermal processing—when vegetables are already falling apart. It’s also advisable to prefer products that contain fiber rather than fiber as a supplement. This is a question of balance as well as price.
- **Avoid taking antibiotics without a doctor’s prescription**;
- **Limit the use of disinfectants** and excessive household detergents;
- Consume **fermented foods** — pickled vegetables, dairy products — they contain beneficial microbiota;
- Try to spend time in nature from time to time — contact with "fresh" non-pathogenic microbes is exactly what is needed—for immune stimulation and for increasing microbial diversity;
- And of course — **avoid stress**. Prolonged stress increases [pro-inflammatory markers in the blood](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5794698/) and subsequently triggers the leaky gut syndrome, or "leaky gut." This is a state of barrier function disruption of the intestinal mucosa, manifested by the penetration of deeper parts of large microorganisms and their metabolic products, leading to inflammatory processes and dysbiotic states in different parts of the digestive tract.

Wishing you serenity and butterflies! :)
