# Why are the products LACTOMILK and the bacteria LACTIC?

The very first thing that comes to mind when you hear the word **"*кисломолочні*"** **--** **"*sour milk*".** Sour milk is a product, right? Therefore -- lactic products.

...And what would you do without such valuable information? :)

And what about the word **"*молочнокислі*"** ? Correct! ... **"*Lactic acid*"**!

And from here, as a good mathematician liked to say, comes the idea that these are the lactic acid bacteria, and what unites them!

Indeed, lactic acid bacteria are not a systematic group of microorganisms, but a ***physiological*** one: the main thing that unites them is the ***ability to ferment sugars with the formation of lactic acid***. And many different microbes can do this in fact, but in common usage only a few come to mind, names of which graces the labels on some, uh, dairy products, starters, and probiotic preparations.

Fans of lifting weights might grimace skeptically at the mention of lactic acid. But recall the scary biochemistry — lactic acid exists in two forms — isomers. In simple terms — it’s the same substances, but not quite. They have the same formula, but the molecule’s shape is a mirror image, and they also have different biological effects. A kind of mirror world at the nano scale. And the lactic acid that makes beginner skiers unable to descend stairs the next day is the D (-) isomer, while the one in kefir package is the L(+) isomer.

So let the products be lactic, the bacteria be lactic-acid, and the lactic acid be in the right form and in the right places! :)
