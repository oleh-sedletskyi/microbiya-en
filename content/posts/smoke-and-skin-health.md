introtext: Thousands of harmful compounds from cigarette smoke penetrate the lungs. Some of them settle as soot on the delicate epithelium, which struggles to get rid of this misfortune by increasing its secretory activity and producing mucus. As a result, smokers are constantly forced to cough it up and spit it out. Another portion, including nicotine, is carried by the blood to all internal organs and tissues, including the skin. This is roughly how we imagine the long journey of a cigarette’s contents to our dark circles under the eyes. But we rarely consider that a lion’s share of tobacco smoke’s content settles on our skin immediately with the smoke. And this happens constantly, while someone’s cigarette is smoking around you—regardless of the number of puffs.

# Smoke and Skin Health

Indeed, at the very first inhale of tobacco smoke, there is vasoconstriction (spasm) of the skin vessels, and as a result — disruption of the skin’s metabolic processes. N-nitrosonor nicotine, present in tobacco smoke, worsens fibroblast migration in the skin, which directly affects wound healing. Therefore, in people who smoke, even the smallest pimple will heal more slowly.

The very plume of smoke, which the retro cinema industry has managed to lend some romance to for vast sums, settles directly on the surface of the skin and does far from romantic things with it. Carcinogens, heavy metals, and combustion products present in tobacco smoke affect the proliferation of these same fibroblasts, bringing these indicators closer to those typical of aged skin. Studies on twins clearly show an increase in the number of wrinkles (especially those characteristic of smokers around the mouth) and the degree of skin pigmentation. One study showed that ten years of smoking accelerate aging by more than two and a half years. Therefore, for example, if you started smoking at 18, after 10 years you’ll be treated as if you are 30.

Tobacco smoke thus causes premature aging, increases susceptibility to irritation, the likelihood of psoriasis, acne, and skin neoplasms. Smoking is also partly associated with atopic dermatitis and eczema.

In molecular biology terms, this sounds like disruption of the expression of proteins responsible for maintaining the epithelial barrier, skin hydration, collagen synthesis, protection against oxidative stress, and anti-inflammatory responses.

In particular, the skin’s defense system against free-radical damage suffers.

And this means that if you smoke, your skin will be less able to protect itself when you dive into chlorinated or ozonated pool water, or sunbathe.

By the way, about tanning — here again there is bad news — nicotine forms complex compounds with melanin, thus contributing to the accumulation of this alkaloid in cells, leading to their intoxication and increased rate of cell death. Moreover, it has been shown that ultraviolet radiation more often causes wrinkle formation in people who smoke, compared to those who do not smoke.

This deleterious synergistic effect exhausts our skin’s regenerative resources and not only speeds up aging but also increases the risk of cancer.

There are also data showing that smoking provokes a vitamin D deficiency, both by worsening its synthesis in the skin and by reducing its absorption from foods.

Tobacco smoke causes skin pigmentation. Accordingly, being in a smoky room or spending time with people who smoke also significantly increases the likelihood of pigment spots, along with other negative effects.

Therefore, not allowing smoking in your presence will indeed be much more effective for preserving the beauty and youth of your skin than “beauty injections” and the most expensive face creams.
