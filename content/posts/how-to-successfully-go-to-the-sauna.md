# How to Successfully Go to the Sauna?

Researchers [say](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0033062019300763?via%3Dihub) that it does reduce cardiovascular risks. Paradoxically, it’s one of those cases where you seem to lie down and do nothing, yet your heart rate rises to 120–150 beats per minute, which corresponds to moderate physical activity. Increased sweating helps lower blood pressure. The rise in temperature promotes peripheral vasodilation and improves exchange processes in the skin.

However, according to [polls](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965229919300998?via%3Dihub), people go to the sauna mainly not to "fix the heart," but for relaxation and to reduce the feeling of stress.

Respondents also noted an improvement in sleep on the first or second night after visiting the sauna.

One of the researchers on this issue [notes](https://www.webmd.com/heart/news/20180116/sauna-may-be-as-good-as-exercise-for-the-heart#1) that a significant role here is played by the forced freedom from devices — people finally detach from their smartphones and enter a kind of meditative state.

**When is it better not to go?**

Patients with unstable angina, recently suffered a myocardial infarction, aortic stenosis, uncontrolled hypertension, or heart failure are advised to avoid the sauna due to an increased risk of strokes or sudden cardiac arrest.

The same applies to cold-water immersion or dunking in a cold pool after spending time in the sauna: in patients with unstable cardiovascular conditions such measures can trigger arrhythmias and other dangerous consequences. If you have doubts, it’s better not to dive headfirst — with this option the probability of fatal outcomes [increases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102597).

However, the main factor in fatal sauna outcomes is [the consumption of alcoholic beverages](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29926439). Therefore, if the word sauna evokes a persistent association with Soviet films, be careful — you are in a risk group.

It is also known that the rise in temperature during a sauna session can [decrease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23411620) the number of sperm and their motility. But [do not rely](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/saunas-and-your-health) on this and neglect contraception. However, if starting a family is in your plans, you may want to [consider](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29731401) this factor.

Do not visit the sauna during [pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/pregnancy/is-it-safe-to-use-a-sauna-or-jacuzzi-if-i-am-pregnant/), especially in the first 12 weeks.

If you do not have the factors listed above and no cardiovascular problems, you [can](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/saunas-and-your-health) safely step out to at least the 3rd floor without stopping; probably the sauna itself won't cause you harm.

**How to go to the sauna and come back?**

- Avoid alcohol and bad company that may bring it, and thereby become a source of not socializing or relaxing, but the need to provide first aid;
- Do not sit in the sauna for more than [15-20 minutes](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/saunas-and-your-health) at a time, and rely on your own sensations;
- If possible, take a horizontal position, because the vertical temperature gradient in the sauna is quite noticeable, and you should heat not just the head, but the whole body;
- cool down after the session slowly, don’t plunge head-first into the pool — that increases risks for both vessels and the head in case of injury;
- drink enough water, this will promote better sweating, protect against dehydration and possible uncomfortable sensations — dizziness, nausea, etc.;
- use headgear or a towel — this will protect the head from overheating;
- use slippers, towels, and sheets to avoid unnecessary infection risks, choose a shower instead of a pool if its cleanliness raises doubts.
