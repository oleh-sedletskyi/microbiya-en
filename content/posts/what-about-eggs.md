introtext: A high school biology course should be enough to understand how eggs appear in the world. Therefore, it is quite logical and expected that their surface hosts Escherichia coli and various spore-forming microorganisms. And not infrequently there are also Staphylococcus, Salmonella, and other often antibiotic-resistant lifeforms with which we would rather not have to deal.

# What about eggs?

The laid eggs are collected, labeled, placed in trays, and sent to the counter. Mostly, without unnecessary hygienic procedures. There are reasons for this — firstly, it’s an extra process that costs money; secondly, eggs spoil quickly because the shell has a porous structure; thirdly, by the time the eggs reach the consumer, most gut bacteria on the surface die; and fourthly, there’s nothing too frightening about it if the hen is healthy and the consumer follows hygiene rules.

So, what are the hygiene rules when it comes to chicken eggs in our kitchen?

When buying eggs in a carton, it’s better to put them right away into a separate bag, and when picking up loose eggs from the counter, it’s useful to use a glove;

You should keep an eye on the production date and choose the freshest eggs. There are also [publications](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168160517303963) that say free-range hens lay eggs with fewer pathogenic bacteria on the shell surface. We choose eggs from free-range hens also for humane reasons;

Store eggs in the refrigerator — preferably in a closed container. It’s good if it’s in the same place every time;

When taking eggs out of the fridge for cooking, it’s better to place them on a plate rather than on the table surface — this prevents them from rolling and breaking, and the microbiota from their surface won’t scatter across your kitchen;

After breaking an egg, the shell is placed in the same plate, not on the table. After finishing with the eggs, discard the shell, wash the plate and your hands;

Do not drink raw eggs — salmonellosis, according to statistics, is [2.1 million cases of poisoning per year in the USA](https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/index.html), and [about 100 thousand in Europe](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/salmonella). Do you need that?
