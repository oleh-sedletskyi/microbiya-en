introtext: Working in a cozy office is what previous generations might have dreamed of when work was mostly physical and hard. Warm, cozy, calm, and within reach for practically any age. However, over time it became clear that replacing one set of problems simply gave rise to others. Who would have thought two hundred years ago that in a well-fed, comfortable society the use of stairs when an elevator is available would become popular, and that mobile apps reminding people to change their body position would be used.

# Office Work: Cozy Yet Difficult

But let’s return to office work. Aside from back or eye pain from long hours staring at a monitor, modern office workers have plenty to complain about. Recently, experts even [modeled](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-7605375/Scientists-create-grotesque-hunched-model-office-workers-look-20-years-time.html) the approximate appearance of a typical office worker based on a range of health problems that arise from prolonged sitting. It turned into a rather sad mannequin with a hunched spine, swollen legs, and red eyes.

The comfort of the workspace is no less important than the comfort of one’s home, since workers can spend as much time there, or even more, than at home. Therefore, proper organization of the office environment influences employees’ willingness to come to work, work efficiently, and value their employer.

[According to](https://life.pravda.com.ua/society/2014/09/23/180813/) one of the 2014 surveys, half of office workers consider their job psychologically exhausting (nerve-wracking). Among the leading complaints are a tense atmosphere in the team, uncomfortable office furniture, and noise. In addition, about a quarter of employees are bothered by drafts and cold from the air conditioner, and just as many feel the office is too stuffy.

In response to stress, we do not have to "fight or flee," as our instincts from the past tell us, but smile and maintain a good posture. The stress hormones that speed up our heart and suppress digestion do not get an appropriate reaction (no one runs away) and this can disrupt the balance of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.

**Work: not a wolf — it won’t run away, it’s sedentary**

A sedentary lifestyle [is associated](http://bit.do/e3rrb) with increased risks of obesity and type 2 diabetes.

Sitting causes neck and back muscle fatigue, worsens circulation, especially in the pelvic area, and negative changes in the function of [the lungs](http://bit.do/e3rri) and a deterioration in sleep quality [sleep.](http://bit.do/e3rrv)

Moreover, prolonged sitting [is linked](http://bit.do/e3rrA) to increased risks of colorectal, endometrial, and breast cancers.

**Posture: not always regal**

Prolonged sitting is inevitably linked to posture disorders — we hunch and tilt toward the monitor to better see the dreaded schedule, and we try to rest a tired head on our hand.

As a result [of this](https://medlineplus.gov/guidetogoodposture.html) — neck, back, and shoulder pain, deterioration of the function of some joints, difficulty in breathing, and even difficulty digesting food!

Uncomfortable furniture can add to the problems too.

**Eyes: tired and red**

Incorrect posture while sitting is also linked to vision deterioration. The monitor placed too close leads to eye strain. And we get so absorbed in our work that we forget to blink, and the cornea dries out. This is also aided by the consistently dry air in office spaces.

**Air: dry and not always fresh**

In most cases, air in offices is too dry. It may be fine for equipment, but it quite noticeably affects the skin, corneas, and mucous membranes of the respiratory tract. And even though we don’t have special receptors telling us that the air is dry, we can feel the lack of humidity as discomfort arises. Coughing, irritation, and dryness of skin and eyes are the most common signs of overly dry air.

**Ventilation: designed too frugally**

Ventilation systems in most office spaces have too few diffusers (air intakes). Consequently, to ensure proper air exchange, the air must move more vigorously, which creates a draft. It’s expected that the worker closest to it will complain about discomfort and will try to get rid of it — for example, switch the fan to a weaker setting. Meanwhile, they will still feel the breeze, and colleagues a bit farther away will constantly lack fresh air. Inadequate ventilation causes a shortage of oxygen and excess carbon dioxide, resulting in weak productivity, a sense of fatigue, and headaches.

For management, it’s important to understand that poor ventilation can easily correlate with the frequency of sick days and, accordingly, with potential losses.

**Humidifiers and air conditioners: proper hygiene is necessary**

According to our rather modest calculations, about half of office workers have to contend with conflicts with colleagues due to either too intense or too weak air conditioning. From this point of view, the problem is similar to ventilation — some closer, some farther away. It’s important to understand that, unlike a draft from a window, which may be stronger or weaker and at different temperatures, the air from the air conditioner is expected to be somewhat cooler than the device’s set temperature. The airflow is steady and constant, so the impact can be quite significant.

Air conditioners can become sources of infection spread, especially if filters are not replaced in time. The same goes for humidifiers — be sure to familiarize yourself with operating rules and clean the reservoir and filter at least as often as recommended. Also, fill it only with clean drinking water and no foreign substances.

**Colleagues: about small habits and big disappointments**

Being under one roof with a large number of people and with different habits inevitably leads to violations of personal space and contested notions of comfort. From changing the air conditioning mode to loud music on a phone — the human factor is an inherent part of the list of office colleagues’ disappointments.

Here are the [most popular](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/uk-office-workers-biggest-gripes-messy-desks-it-issues-smelly-food-air-conditioning-chairs-gossip-a7923756.html) complaints employees have about each other:

* Loud personal phone conversations;
* Very sharp and intense perfumes;
* Smoking and unpleasant smell (and smokers often have a dulled sense of smell and may not even identify their own body odor);
* Habit of eating at the workplace;
* Habit of turning on music or watching videos without headphones;
* Loud and unpleasant phone ringtone;
* Habit of not cleaning up after themselves in the kitchen;
* Habit of loudly blowing their nose;
* Being at the workplace while sick and infecting colleagues.

**How to witness improvement: a quest for zen**

Tips for improvement here may seem quite obvious.

* Take steps to move more: take active-breaks; use a timer or mobile apps that remind you to take a break; instead of sending messages to colleagues, walk up to them and discuss the issue when possible; park along the perimeter of the parking lot — it’s a good opportunity for an extra hundred steps; use lunchtime for a walk. A popular solution that has gained quite a lot of traction is standing desks — they allow you to adjust height and work standing for a while instead of sitting; another popular measure some companies use is holding standing meetings — this allows movement and also shortens their duration;
* Mindfully monitor your posture — over time this will become a habit. Comfortable furniture helps with this. Make sure you have a comfortable chair. If you’re the one who can influence office setup — this is a good investment in your employees’ comfort and in their desire to stay with your company in the long run.
* Take breaks not only to move but also for a bit of eye gymnastics. It helps the eyes rest and prevents excessive corneal drying. A timer or special apps can come in handy here;
* Let there be a hygrometer in a prominent place in the office and keep its readings between 40-60%. A humidifier will help maintain these numbers. But don’t forget to clean it regularly so it doesn’t become a source of air contamination. Never add any foreign or aromatic substances to the water in the humidifier — this can be a lung hazard;
* Avoid using the air conditioner if it’s not necessary. Monitor its cleaning regime and timely filter changes;
* Keep your phone on silent and don’t force colleagues to listen to your personal conversations; use headphones, even during lunch if you suddenly feel like listening to a song or watching the new episode of a “damned rationalist” or “interesting science” (yes, this is native advertising, subscribe — truly cool channels);
* Don’t eat at your desk! First, leftovers get onto office equipment and can cause damage; second, this creates an environment not only for transmission but also for the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria; third, the sounds and smells associated with eating at the desk do not help your reputation; fourth, it fosters unhealthy eating behavior and can contribute to weight gain; fifth, you simply deprive yourself of a chance to move and walk to the kitchen. Remember to CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF IMMEDIATELY;
* Quit smoking or do your best so that colleagues don’t have to hold their breath when they see you. If you smoke, your sense of smell may be dulled, so maintain personal cleanliness but don’t overdo it with perfumes! It’s not bad to directly ask someone if your perfumes are too strong, because colleagues are unlikely to tell you themselves; instead they’ll keep their distance and speak more coolly.
* Stay home when you’re sick. Don’t make colleagues listen to your coughing, sniffing, and spreading illness. Think this is trivial? Colleagues at home may have children, pregnant wives, or elderly parents for whom a simple cold can be much worse, so don’t gift them such inconveniences.
* Don’t be shy about voicing your needs and discomforts — life is one, health is the most valuable, and there are many workplaces.
