introtext: Our convenient and full world has become acquainted with the problem of excess weight ever since it became so convenient and full. And if you are also a permanent author of "I am prone to overweight" — then you are almost doomed to clothing for the "big guys" and a self-soothing worldview that "a good person should have a lot." Or not?

# How to eat tasty and rich, but stay in shape – results of successful experiments

Researchers from California conducted a very interesting, though at first glance simple, experiment. Part of the test mice had access to high-calorie food around the clock, while the other part – only in a 10-hour window per day. The amount of food consumed in both cases was the same. It turned out that animals that ate at arbitrary times developed metabolic disorders, while the other mice, who ate the same amount but within 10 hours, remained healthy.

In addition, a portion of the mice in the study was genetically defective — with inactive "biological clock" genes, meaning their susceptibility to obesity, diabetes, fatty liver disease, and elevated cholesterol levels. The 10-hour eating window in this case also helped avoid the development of such diseases.

“For many of us, the day starts with a cup of coffee early in the morning and ends with a snack before bed after 14-15 hours,” says a professor from the Salk Institute laboratory. “But consuming the daytime diet within 10 hours and refraining from eating at other times can significantly improve our health, regardless of our biological clock and genetic predispositions.”

Comments from us:

At first glance, this seems like a remake of “don’t eat after six,” but it is also a potential opportunity to treat yourself to a fatty-sugary snack at 9 PM… if you have breakfast at 11 AM :)

Also, let’s not forget that these results were obtained in mouse studies. The probability of a similar outcome in humans is incredibly high, but not 100%. However, what in our troubled world has a 100% guarantee?.. :)
