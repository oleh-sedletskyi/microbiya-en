introtext: Traveling to another country is always a new adventure, a plunge into a different society and a different … biocenosis. You will have to bargain not only with border guards but also with the local microbiota. It’s also important to understand that the rapid development of transportation networks fosters the rapid exchange of microbial pathogens of various diseases between the most distant parts of the world.

# About Microbes: A Traveler’s Reminder

**What microbes might travelers encounter?**

According to statistics, the most common hiccup tourists face is the so-called "traveler’s diarrhea." New food, water, and the environment contain a huge amount of microorganisms, including pathogenic ones, which, however, often do not have such pronounced negative effects on local residents.

Most often, the cause of "traveler’s diarrhea" is enterotoxigenic strains of Escherichia coli, sometimes -- Campylobacter (in South Asia). In addition to bacteria, viruses (rotaviruses, Norwalk virus – more often affecting closed groups of people — cruise ships, tour groups) and protozoa (cryptosporidia -- in hotel swimming pools) can cause this syndrome. In the list of intestinal infections that can threaten travelers, one can add cholera as well — if you’re really unlucky.

High risk of traveler’s diarrhea is present in countries of [Latin America](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9B%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D0%90%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0), [Africa](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%90%D1%84%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0), [the Middle East](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%91%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B7%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%A1%D1%85%D1%96%D0%B4), [South Asia](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D1%96%D0%B2%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%90%D0%B7%D1%96%D1%8F) and [South-East Asia](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D1%96%D0%B2%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE-%D0%A1%D1%85%D1%96%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%90%D0%B7%D1%96%D1%8F).

Another danger is **insect bites** that not only bother or scare but also **can transmit dangerous diseases**. This concerns mosquitoes, ticks, some flies. They can carry malaria, the Zika virus, leishmaniasis, Lyme disease, tick-borne encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever, sleeping sickness, chikungunya virus.

**The natural reservoir of pathogens for many human diseases is indeed wild animals.** Yes, for example, many wild animals can be infected with rabies, steppe rodents of Asia can carry plague (remember the recent outbreak of bubonic plague in Mongolia — when tourists hunted a diseased marmot), birds — avian influenza, bats in Africa — the Marburg and Ebola viruses.

In addition to such scares, there exist less refined, but sometimes no less dangerous diseases, such as those transmitted sexually and through blood. This is a needless reminder for advocates of sex tourism and those who like to bring home new tattoos from their travels.

Among more terrestrial troubles one can mention **fungal skin diseases**, especially on the feet. Also — our common colds, flu, chickenpox, rubella, measles — if you are unlucky, for example, with neighbors on the plane and for some reason you are unvaccinated.

**However, it’s not that terrible — take precautions so as not to fall into such situations.**

So, tickets are purchased, the hotel is booked. Whether it’s an all-inclusive trip, a yacht cruise, a “hop around Europe” with hand luggage, a mountain trek, or camping — **buy travel insurance, agree the route**. It’s good if the insurance company has a solid reputation and covers expenses not only for “transporting the body home.” And figure out the detailed action plan in case of “what to do” — BEFORE the trip. **Save the phone number** in your contacts, where you will call if needed.

A banal but important tip — **before the trip, find out about possible infectious risks inherent to the region**. It’s also useful to read up-to-date news about the country you are traveling to.

In some cases you may need to **supplement your list of vaccinations**, such as yellow fever vaccination if you’re drawn to wild Africa, or tick-borne encephalitis if you plan to spend a lot of time outdoors in endemic zones for this disease.

When traveling, use only **bottled water**. This is especially true for so-called "exotic" countries. If that is not possible, boil the water. If you want to be extra cautious, also drink bottled water **on board the plane**, because [according to some](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4661625/) data, the quality of water on board may not be as good as one would like.

Do not swallow water in a **pool**. The American Water Quality and Health Council conducted a survey last year showing that more than half of respondents do not shower before entering a pool. A third of those who do use the shower before swimming do so for less than a minute, which, you’ll agree, is far from enough to wash. Every fourth person admitted to having relieved themselves in the pool at least once (and who knows how many did not confess?). 17% of respondents admitted that diarrhea would not prevent them from using a pool where others swim. Learn more [here](https://waterandhealth.org/healthy-pools/would-you-know-if-your-local-pool-failed-its-health-inspection-unlikely-survey-reveals/). On other risks related to pools — in our publication — [here](baseyn-i-mikrobi.html).

**Vegetables and fruits** are better peeled rather than washed if you doubt the quality of water.

Do not consume **street food**. Avoid eating **oysters, seafood, and reef fish** — reef fish may contain saxitoxin (a toxin produced by some algae that live near reefs and are eaten by fish).

Avoid dishes with **insufficient heat treatment** (blood rare steak, poached eggs, shishkebab, etc.).

Carefully **read warning signs, follow laws and rules.** They may have been created not only to prevent you from picking flowers from bushes, but perhaps to protect you from some poisonous spiders that may be on them.

Stay **away from animals**, especially wild ones. Do not feed monkeys, raccoons, even if they are very cute;

If there is a risk of disease transmission through bites of insects — **use repellents**. Do not forget headgear — mosquitoes, for example, bite well even on the hairy part of the head.

Do not be tempted by services of a beachside tattoo parlor — and the same goes for a **manicure** — such procedures are better done in salons where you are confident in aseptic practices;

If you have doubts about cleanliness in the hotel where you are staying, **treat light switches and door handles with disinfectant** in the room. The TV remote control is better placed in a plastic bag right away. Do not use the **bedspread**, which is often not changed together with the linen.

Don’t forget to **wash your hands**, disinfect your **mobile device** and avoid people with signs of respiratory illnesses.

May your travels always be pleasant and bring only good surprises!
