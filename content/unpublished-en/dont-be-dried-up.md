introtext: Winter and the heating season, both literally and figuratively, are in full swing. We spend a lot of time indoors and often hardly open the windows. The fact of working heating is something to be glad about, even despite its cost. However, with dry air and insufficient ventilation, a number of uncomfortable phenomena are associated.

# Don’t Dry Out

According to one of the [surveys](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25727348?dopt=Abstract), symptoms related to the feeling of dry air are among the main causes of discomfort for office workers.

**What is the optimal air humidity?**

[Recommended](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1438463917306946) indoor relative humidity is 40-60%. At higher values, the risk of mold growth gradually increases, and at lower humidity, these uncomfortable phenomena can occur.

**When humidity is too low...**

We lose more water through evaporation. The skin becomes drier, irritations may appear. The mucous membranes — the respiratory tract and eyes — suffer especially. There may be discomfort in the nose, nasal congestion, eyes tire more quickly and may hurt. If you sit in front of a monitor all day and blink little (and we indeed blink rarely when looking at a monitor), by evening our eyes look less like “bottomless lakes” and more like a different kind of body of water, forgive the blunt comparison.

Insufficient humidity can also cause sleep disturbances. Small children are especially sensitive to it, as dry air can cause symptoms similar to a cold — sniffling, sneezing, and even coughing.

Additionally, at lower humidity, dust and dirt particles linger longer in the air. There are [data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412018320725?via%3Dihub#bb0465) showing that this can contribute to longer persistence of viruses and bacteria in the air.

**What to do about it?**

- First of all — get a hygrometer;

Because, as researchers [note](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412018320725?via%3Dihub#f0005), we don’t have receptors to assess humidity itself.

And, it’s fair to note that the feeling of dryness and irritation can also be caused by other [factors](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1034/j.1600-0668.2003.00202.x), including dust and chemical air pollution, reduced oxygen concentration, and even side effects of medications.

- Adjust the humidity if it is indeed low;

This can be done in various ways. Manufacturers offer a rich selection of **humidifiers** — with different operating principles and at different prices. We will not review them here, but it is **very important that this device be easy to clean**. After all, dirt and microbes may rush into our lungs. Also read the manufacturer’s recommendations carefully and **fill the humidifier only with clean, preferably distilled water**. Hard water can irritate the respiratory organs and over time create a white coating on surfaces. **Do not use any fragrances or disinfectants** — this is an additional risk of sensitization, and, as we already [mentioned](4.html), may carry significantly [more serious](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5102846/) consequences.

**Misuse of humidifiers, their untimely cleaning only worsens the situation**, as confirmed by researchers’ work.

Besides a stylish modern humidifier, you can fix the situation in a less stylish way — for example, **hang drying clothes in the room** (be careful with strong-smelling detergents).

Another option is **houseplants**. The main thing is not to forget to water them and not make them yet another victim of insufficient moisture.

Also, when possible, turn off printers, scanners, and other equipment that can heat up — when you are not using them;

- Use skin and nose moisturizers;

- Drink enough water;

How much exactly — it’s nicely written here on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=%D1%81%D0%BA%D1%96%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%B8%20%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B8%20%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B8&epa=SEARCH_BOX). And we simply remind you that this is one of the key points that will prevent us from “dries out.”

- Try to blink more often and take frequent short breaks;

As [stated](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ina.12322) by researchers, it is enough to periodically **take a break from the monitor for 30-60 seconds** and blink. (no, this is not a reason to smoke a cigarette).

There are also **special programs** that you can install on your computer and that will remind you every 15-20 minutes to blink or perform a short eye exercise.

- More frequent wet cleaning;

This adds moisture and reduces dust that irritates the eyes and respiratory tract. This applies not only to floors but to all other possible surfaces.

If humidity is within normal ranges and the unpleasant symptoms and discomfort persist, be sure to consult a doctor.

May your home be cozy, and your workspace inspiring!
