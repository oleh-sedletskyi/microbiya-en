# How to clean your teeth and not go crazy

Teeth must be cleaned of dental plaque that accumulates on the surface of the enamel. Its formation is a completely natural process. Over time, plaque becomes the basis for the formation of other dental deposits — plaques and calculus — which pose a real threat to the health of teeth and gums.

Regular hygienic procedures and a balanced, wholesome diet are the foundation of preventing caries and gingivitis.

Routine oral hygiene typically includes [3 obligatory components]((http:/www.knowyourteeth.com/infobites/abc/article/?abc=D&iid=184&aid=3806):

* brushing teeth with a toothbrush [twice a day](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/expert-answers/brushing-your-teeth/faq-20058193) for two to three minutes;

* using dental floss or interdentAl brushes once a day;

* using mouthwash after every meal.

But even a responsible approach to hygiene does not negate [two visits to the dentist per year](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17943814) for professional cleaning.

"*In my practice there are patients who came to me five years ago with a large number of carious cavities. After fillings and under professional care up to this time there has not been a single case of caries.*"

***"About chewing gum:** they really help a little with mechanical cleaning of teeth, but nothing more. As for the acid-base balance — that is a marketing tale.*

*And toothpicks are harmful to the gums. It is better to replace them with floss."*

**One of the common bases for argument is the question of when to brush in the morning — immediately after waking up, or after breakfast?**

This question provokes many disagreements not only among patients but also among dentists themselves.

Dental associations of various countries recommend brushing teeth twice a day for 2-3 minutes. It is clearly emphasized that evening oral hygiene is the last thing a person should do before bed. But there are no specific instructions regarding morning brushing. It is not even stated that the first "non-evening" brushing must necessarily be in the morning.

The point is that evening tooth brushing is what can significantly protect us from the formation of dental deposits. During sleep, plaque forms more actively because a person does not move the jaw and tongue, and saliva secretion decreases.

Care for the teeth after waking up is undoubtedly necessary. But it should be taken into account that wake-up times vary among people. Some do not have breakfast at all in the morning. Therefore the start of morning hygiene is a purely individual matter.

It is also important to add the question of the quality of brushing during morning preparations! According to some studies, many people perform morning dental hygiene care somewhat carelessly due to a lack of free time. According to data from the UK National Health Service, the average time of morning tooth brushing is 45 seconds.

In this case, dentists [recommend](http://www.knowyourteeth.com/infobites/abc/article/?abc=s&iid=184&aid=1215) brushing teeth at work after lunch, which demonstrates truly good results.

**What determines the susceptibility to caries in the first place? What are the main factors affecting the development of caries?**

Currently there is no single concept of the causes of caries development. There is a lack of convincing evidence of genetic predisposition to carious lesions. There is a shortage of data that would allow calculating the share of influence of each factor.

caries-causing microorganisms are constantly present in the oral cavity of every person, so talking about the possibility of infection with them here is not appropriate.

**A deficiency of B vitamins, vitamin D, and calcium, as noted by some specialists, is considered a risk factor. Such a condition can sometimes be observed in vegans and vegetarians. Therefore, in such cases, in addition to preventive examinations, monitoring the presence of sources of these nutrients in the diet and even taking special dietary supplements is [desirable](http://www.knowyourteeth.com/infobites/abc/article/?abc=d&iid=315&aid=1273).**

Effective **caries prevention methods** are well known:

* adhere to a full and regular ** oral hygiene** routine;

* limit consumption of foods rich in **simple carbohydrates and acids**

* maintain a balanced **diet**

* drink and cook with **fluoridated** water;

* quit **smoking;**

* twice a year **visit a dentist** and perform **professional hygiene**.

It is currently known that the risk of caries can increase with a number of diseases. Most often this is diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. In such cases, it is recommended to strengthen monitoring of the condition of teeth and gums with the participation of a specialist.

**Today there is a wide range of toothbrushes on the market, including electric ones. Is their use really more justified than that of regular brushes?**

Electric toothbrushes are indeed more effective. But it should be noted that the effect of their use becomes pronounced only after 3-4 months of use.

**About whitening teeth: is it safe to whiten teeth and what most affects tooth color?**

It should be taken into account that the color of permanent teeth from the moment of eruption is also **not initially white**. Most Ukrainians have a light-yellow or light-gray tint of enamel.

The color of teeth is most influenced by **smoking, consumption of colored beverages** (coffee, tea, red wine) and **colored vegetables** (carrots, beets).

Professional hygiene, when used regularly, helps maintain the natural color.

Enamel whitening may be indicated only in truly severe cases. For example, with daily smoking and consumption of more than four cups of coffee and in the absence of systematic home hygiene.

It is important to remember that there is no such thing as absolutely safe and effective whitening. There is always a risk of developing tooth sensitivity after such a procedure. Do not use home whitening systems. In ten years of practice I have not had patients who could achieve the same good result at home as in a clinic. And patients who harmed their health in the process do exist with me and with every one of my colleagues. Do not experiment on yourself.

**And should you use whitening pastes?**

Only on the advice of a doctor. It is worth noting that such pastes are usually used for a limited time (no more than a week or two).

Health of teeth — it is not only aesthetics! How does dental health affect other aspects of our health?

You can start even from the appearance of Cro-Magnons. The average life expectancy at the time of their appearance was about 20 years. Tooth health at such a lifespan was more than enough. And although anatomically and physiologically we are no different from them, our average life expectancy has increased threefold. Populations of developed countries are aging relentlessly. Therefore today many questions in medicine and dentistry focus on improving the quality of life of the older generation.

The health of teeth and effective chewing of food also influence the health of the digestive system to some extent. In addition, diseased teeth can be a source of other infectious and inflammatory processes in the body. Maintaining oral health from birth and proper care of the teeth throughout life is one of the components of general and social health of a person and a truly effective way to protect oneself from many other health problems. Take care of your teeth from a young age!
